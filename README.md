It provides a PyTorch implementation of the proposed LRU-based model for black-box modeling of nonlinear audio distortion circuits, such as diode clippers and overdrive pedals.

## Overview

For quick reference, a minimal training script (`train_dummy.py`) is included.  
It shows how to instantiate and train the model (`model.py`) on a toy dataset of white-noise sequences processed through a `tanh` nonlinearity.  
This example also illustrates the expected input/output tensor format: `(batch_size, sequence_length, 1)`.

- Uses [`mambapy`](https://github.com/alxndrTL/mamba.py) for the efficient prefix-scan (`pscan`) operation.
